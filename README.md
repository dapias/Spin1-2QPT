# Spin1-2QPT

Code in Julia-Language provided to solve the six first exercises (concerning to Quantum Phase transitions for a spin 1/2 chain -XXZ model-) of the Lecture notes *Introduction to the computational analysis of static properties and dynamics of one-dimensional spin-1/2 systems* written by Professor **Lea Santos** that you may download from [here](https://www.yu.edu/faculty-bios/santos/computer-codes).


To interact with the code clone this repository by executing on a terminal
```
$ git clone https://github.com/dapias/Spin1-2QPT.git
```

It is needed to have installed julia on your computer. Instructions are provided [here](http://julialang.org/downloads/).
